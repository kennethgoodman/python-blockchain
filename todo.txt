Need to:

1. Cryptography
	Basic ECC to sign and send transactions <- included in Script
	Schnorr Signatures - Aggregated Signatures
	Zero-Knowledge Proofs
	Ring Signatures
	Bullet Proofs
	Sidechains/Drivechains
	Homomorphic Encryption? 
2. Networking to find new nodes
3. Networking when sending found blocks to peers
4. Dandelion 2.0?
	When recieving new blocks, ask for two random transactions (by index) and their merkle proof
5. Scripting language
	Same as Script?
	micropayments as an open channel on the blockchain:
		Create payment channel from X -> Y (lock up N coins)
		X gives Y a tuple: (tx, signature) where signature = sig(tx)
		X can continue to give Y tuples up to N
		Y can publish at any time and take the miner fee to do that
		X can either leave it open or close the channel, Y will have 2 days to claim any coins before X can spend again
		X pays for 2 transactions - open and
	micropayments full on blockchain:
		Create payment channel from X -> Y (lock up N coins) - tx = (X,Y,channel_id,N), channel = (tx,sig(tx))
		X publishes (0 <= amount <= N, signature, channel_id) to blockchain
			cheaper because it is smaller
6. Test multiple nodes
		some going offline - what if all nodes go offline?
		some coming back online
7. Verying incoming blocks
	need to finish final cases
8. SPV nodes
9. Creating transactions
10. Take out timestamp from transactions - why do we need them?
11. Block size?
12. Difficulty Adjustment
13. sha = hash function randomly permutated from n hash functions, say n = 100? 
14. SegWit
15. UTXO node as well
